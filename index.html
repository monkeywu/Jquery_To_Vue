                <h1>Enjoy Surfing</h1>
                <p>It started day one. The day Lisa ripped in those boardshorts, the day Sarah dropped into the superpipe and
                    the day Kelia log-dropped into Teahupo’o. We’ve always been real, and we’ve always been restless. We
                    have that special something. Something confident. Something original. We know what we like, who we are,
                    what we want, when we need it — and we need it now. More than ever, positive leaders are being cast.
                    Someone, and something to point the way. To set the example. To rep real, to push new, and to be next,
                    now. Here’s an invitation to join our trip. To put some heart into it. And to show others that they can
                    do the same. Make Waves. Move Mountains.
                </p>

                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Like all things Enjoysufing, Enjoysufing was born in the water; initially a swimwear line, it debuted in late summer 1990 to immediate success. By the next year, a Enjoysufing sportswear line was introduced, and that too prospered, with sales of over $1 million. 1992 saw continued expansion of the brand with a new denim line and key snowwear pieces. The fact that Enjoysufing was a women's line offered by an authentic surf brand made it intriguing for both retailers and girls alike. It was the first of its kind on the market, and soon after, the other surf brands followed.</p>
    
                <p>By 1993, Enjoysufing was on a serious roll. The ever-popular Enjoysufing logo was born, a heart-shaped crest adapted from the recognizable Quiksilver logo. The brand's popularity was growing, as was its staff. And then one afternoon in Hawaii, as legend has it, the Enjoysufing crew was sitting on a beach watching the surf when they came up with the idea of the women's board short. Offering fit and flexibility while still managing to be feminine, the women's boardshort was an innovation that forever changed the women's surf market. It was also the perfect example of what the Enjoysufing brand had originally set out to be, in the words of Quiksilver's 1990 Annual Report: "Fun, Bold, Athletic, Daring and Classy". The boardshort became a huge trend. Enjoysufing, and women's surfing along with it, was suddenly the next big thing.</p>
    
                <p>The success of this event led to other Enjoysufing competitions, including: the Enjoysufing Pro Fiji, the Enjoysufing Pro Gold Coast (Australia), and the Enjoysufing Jam UK, all ASP World Championship Tour events; the Enjoysufing Pro Women's Surf Festival (Australia), one of the biggest World Qualifying Series events on the tour; and a series of amateur surf contests for young surfers the world over. With such substantial event sponsorship and an ever-expanding team, Enjoysufing is proud to be the largest corporate sponsor of women's surfing worldwide.</p>
